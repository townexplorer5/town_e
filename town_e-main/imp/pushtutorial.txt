## 🧭 STEP 1 — In your local project folder

Open your **terminal** inside your project folder:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

---

## 🧩 STEP 2 — Initialize and commit your files

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for MyTown Explorer"
```

---

## 🌐 STEP 3 — Connect to your existing GitHub repo

Replace the URL below with **your repo’s URL**:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
```

---

## 🧹 STEP 4 — Force push to overwrite the repo

This is the key command 👇
It will **delete all files on GitHub’s main branch** and replace them with yours:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main --force
```

---

## ✅ STEP 5 — Confirm

Go to your GitHub repo page and refresh.
You’ll now see **only your local files** — everything old will be gone.

---

Would you like me to write a `.gitignore` specifically suited to your **MyTown Explorer** project (HTML/JS/CSS + assets + data JSON)?
